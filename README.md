## I have an issue!
Please see if the answer is in the frequently answered questions.
#### FAQ
##### 1.  I can't open a video I downloaded
Sometimes a video gets downloaded in a format that isn't supported by all media players. This can be fixed by watching the video in VLC media player, or by transcoding it to another format.
##### 2.  The download appears to be stuck on 'Merging audio and video...'
The progress bar shows the amount of data that is downloaded from YouTube. The audio and video gets downloaded seperately and then merged together, this can take a considerable amount of time with large files. So please be patient.
##### 3. How do I download private videos?
Please take a look at the tutorial on this subject. It can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jely2002/youtube-dl-gui/wiki/Tutorial:-Private-videos-&-playlists)
